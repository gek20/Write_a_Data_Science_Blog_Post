# UDACITY Seattle Airbnb

#Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

# Content
The following Airbnb activity is included in the [Seattle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle):

"Listings.csv" : including full descriptions and average review score
"Reviews.csv" : including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
"Calendar.csv" : including listing id and the price and availability for that day

### Business Understanding

These were the questions we decided to explore in our dataset:
1- Check the average availability and the average price of rooms in the different months of the year
2- Try to identify which area is more subject to the fluctuation over the months
3- Which are the features that affect the price? Is the location one of them?
