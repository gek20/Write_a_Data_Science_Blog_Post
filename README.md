# UDACITY Seattle Airbnb
This project is part of the Udactiy Data Scientist Nanodegree. 
The goal is to use the CRISP-DM process to explore the data and explain your findings.

## Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.
The following Airbnb activity is included in the [Seattle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle):

* "Listings.csv" : including full descriptions and average review score
* "Reviews.csv" : including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* "Calendar.csv" : including listing id and the price and availability for that day

the file "seattle_airbnb_project.ipynb" contains the code used to analyze the data.

## Business Understanding

We are trying to answer the following questions:
* Which are the neighborhood with more Airbnb locations?
* What are the features that most affect the price? Is the location one of those?
* Which areas are more affected by fluctuations in price/availability over the months?

## Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need the following packages:

For the analysis:
* pandas 
* numpy 
* re
* datetime 
* sklearn

For the graphic part: 
* matplotlib 
* seaborn 
* colorcet 
* warnings
