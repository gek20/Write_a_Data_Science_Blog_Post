# UDACITY Seattle Airbnb

#Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

These were the questions we decided to explore in our dataset:
1- Which are the neighborhood with more Airbnb locations?
